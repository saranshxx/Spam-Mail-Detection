# Spam-Mail-Detection
This project implements an Email Spam Detection System using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using different models such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.

ðŸš€ Features

Preprocessing of email text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)

Multiple machine learning models trained for spam detection:

Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)

Random Forest Classifier (RFC)

Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)

Pre-trained models (.pkl files) included for quick predictions.

Jupyter Notebook (EMAIL_SPAM_DETECTION.ipynb) for training, evaluation, and visualization.

Python script (email_spam_detection.py) for making predictions with saved models.
